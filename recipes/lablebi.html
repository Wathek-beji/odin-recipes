  <h3>A dish from the people, for the people</h3>
  <p>Lablebi is a flavorful and hearty Tunisian chickpea stew, perfect for the winter season.</p>
  <p>It is a humble and inexpensive dish that has become a staple for many Tunisians.</p>
  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cups dried chickpeas</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>4 slices bread </li>
    <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground caraway</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons harissa</li>
    <li>1 lemon</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
    <li>4 eggs</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>250 grams of canned tuna</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Instructions</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Soak the chickpeas in a large amount of water with baking soda for 12 hours.</li>
    <li>After soaking, drain and rinse the chickpeas thoroughly.</li>
    <li>Cook the chickpeas and two pressed cloves of garlic in 4 cups (1 liter) of water, without salt, and over high heat for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Reduce the heat to medium, cover and cook for 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Skim the white foam that may form and add water to keep chickpeas immersed</li>
    <li>Cook until the chickpeas are tender.</li>
    <li>Add salt to the chickpeas 5 minutes before the end of cooking.</li>
  </ol>
  <h5>Seasoning</h5>
  <ol>
    <li>In a bowl, add the lemon juice, olive oil, remaining garlic, harissa, caraway and half of the cumin. Add salt and mix well with a whisk. Set aside.</li>
  </ol>
  <h5>Poached eggs</h5>
  <ol>
    <li>In a saucepan, bring 3 cups (750ml) of water with 3 tablespoons of vinegar to a boil.</li>
    <li>Break the eggs in small saucers, taking care not to break the yolk. Set aside.</li>
    <li>When the water comes to a boil, give it a whirl with a fork or a whisk, with a circular motion (like a whirlpool).</li>
    <li>Slide the eggs one at a time. The rotating movement allows the white to immediately wrap the yolk.</li>
    <li>Poach for 3 to 4 minutes while keeping the water simmering.</li>
    <li>Remove the egg with a slotted spoon and place in a bowl of ice water for 3 seconds to stop the cooking. Then, place on a cloth to drain.</li>
    <li>Season the poached eggs with salt about 2 minutes after cooking. Keep the eggs warm between two plates.</li>
  </ol>
  <h5>Assembly</h5>
  <ol>
    <li>In a deep dish or large bowl, place a few pieces of bread.</li>
    <li>Laden over chickpeas with a little of the broth.</li>
    <li>Place a poached egg on top, as well as tuna and olives.</li>
    <li>Add 2 tablespoons of seasoning.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle with remaining cumin. Enjoy very hot.</li>
