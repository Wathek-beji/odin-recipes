    <h3>A delicious spicy egg dish for those chilly winter days</h3>
    <p>
      My preferred egg dish is Shakshuka, it's the <em>perfect</em> comfort food particularly during cold days because it's spicy and satisfying.<br>
      This meal has its roots in North Africa, particularly in Tunisia, but it has gained popularity as a Middle Eastern cuisine.<br><br>
      Although there are several shakshuka variations, the classic recipe entails poaching eggs in a blend of tomatoes, green peppers, onions, garlic, and spices.
